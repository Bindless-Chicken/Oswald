Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (also known as Oswald the Rabbit or Oswald Rabbit) is an anthropomorphic rabbit and animated cartoon character created by Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney for funny animal films distributed by Universal Pictures in the 1920s and 1930s, serving as the Disney studio's first animated character to feature in their own series.  
26 animated Oswald one-reelers were produced at Walt Disney Animation Studios (the Walt Disney Studio at the time) before Walt Disney was eventually separated from the project and went on to create Mickey Mouse.  
Charles Mintz, and later Walter Lantz, took over production, creating new Oswald cartoons until 1943.
