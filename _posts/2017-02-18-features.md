  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  
   
   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.


## Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.


## Images

The theme offer the possibility to display "large images" that goes outside of the text column.  
To show one, you will need to use, {: .large-content}, after the image. (Note: this applies to every container, code too)

![One](../assets/content/features.jpg 'Normal image')

![Two](../assets/content/features.jpg 'Large image')
{: .large-content}


## Code and Syntax Highlighting
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
{: .large-content}


## Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote. 


## Mathematics

This theme supports mathjax syntax. To activate it add 'mathjax: yes' to your post header and specify your equations.

$$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) $$

Or even inline! \\( \omega = d\phi / dt \\)
